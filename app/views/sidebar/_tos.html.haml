          The City of Boston (&quot;City&quot;) provides the Adopt-a-Hydrant program (&quot;AHA&quot;) to you subject to the following Terms of Service Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.

          Description of Adopt-a-Hydrant
        %p
          Adopt-a-Hydrant is an initiative of the City to encourage residents to shovel out snowed-in fire hydrants. The AAH website allows users to &quot;adopt&quot; a fire hydrant, or state that you intend to help shovel that fire hydrant out if it gets covered by snow.
        %p
          Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance AAH are covered by this Agreement.
      %li
        %h3
          Obligations
        %p
          If you choose to adopt a fire hydrant using the AAH website, you are under no obligation and have no responsibility to actually shovel out that fire hydrant or any fire hydrant.
      %li
        %h3
          Termination of Obligations
        %p
          If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, or the City has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, the City has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the AAH services (or any portion thereof).
        %p
          Accounts that consistently adopt fire hydrants without shoveling them out may also be terminated.
        %p
          Additionally, you agree that the City may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, limit your access to, or suspend your AAH service. Cause for such termination, limitation of access, or suspension shall include but not be limited to:
